One day I'll be a real operating system :)

** Setup

You'll need:
- rust / rustup
- qemu

I am building on Linux x86_64, have not tested building on any other architectures or operating systems.

You'll also need to setup a few targets:
#+begin_src sh
  rustup target add x86_64-unknown-uefi
  rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
#+end_src
