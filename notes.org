* Operating System Notes

** Tasks
*** DONE Init git repo
*** DONE Setup skeleton builds using cargo workspaces
**** DONE Peruse the Cargo book to figure out how to use workspaces

*** TODO Empty UEFI bootloader

*** TODO Empty bare-bones freestanding binary (no-std, no-main)
- empty panic handler stuff too

*** TODO Actual skeleton kernel builds
- build {kernel, bootloader}
- create GPT disk image that has a FAT filesystem (for UEFI)
- Also need to include the kernel somewhere in the disk image
- I guess at some path or rootfs? I don't know how this should work.
  I also don't know how to figure out how this should work

** Notes
*** State of the repo
Try not to leave the repo in a half-committed state. Makes it really hard to pick the project
back up again. Find good stopping points and leave notes so it's easy to work on another day.
